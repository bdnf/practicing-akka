# Implementing simple Akka Actor Model examples

Akka is an Actor Model that allows you:
- high-level abstractions for distribution, concurrency and parallelism
- fault-tolerance with "let-it-crash" semantics
- supervision hierarchies
- location transparency to work in distributed environment
- all interactions of actors use pure message passing and everything is asynchronous
- persistence to allow actor recover their state

and more with Akka Streams and Akka Http library

This repository contains `example codes` on main functionality,
and was made during learning the Akka framework.

[Here are some examples for fast reference](/src/main/scala)
